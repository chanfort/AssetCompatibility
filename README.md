# Asset Compatibility Project

This repository contains a basic project which allows developers to include or exclude particular classes for compilation. The project was originally inspired by forum discussion available here: https://forum.unity.com/threads/check-if-devs-has-assets.388182/.

The project contains 2 different classes ClassA and ClassB. Developer then can select or deselect the toggle which generates or removes compilation constant from scripting define symbols. This allows developers to exclude classes from compilation. This approach can be handy when writing 3rd extensions in order to check if project contains particular assets.
